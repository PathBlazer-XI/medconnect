        <div>We receive some information from the third parties when you contact us or make purchases. For example, when you subscribe to our service, we receive information relating to the transaction from payment providers such as Google Play and Stripe. We may also receive such information as you have shared with third parties voluntarily, such as other websites and online services which then share such data with us, typically anonymised. You can control how much of your information and activity social media websites track and share by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h3><div>We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with third parties such as analytics tools, marketing or customer service software providers and ad networks which we use to track performance of our ads and serve additional ads to interested customers or users. If we are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business reorganization, we may also share or transfer your personal and non-personalinformation to our successors-in-interest.<br><br>We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and the app, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through the app or website. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for you.<br><br>We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited the app in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the app. They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the app and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers. We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND END USERS?</h3><div>MEDCONNECTNEU will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive personal information about you from third parties as described above.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">HOW DO WE USE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS?</h3><div>By submitting your email address to sign up or create an account for any of our products and services, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email.

Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however,you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to opt out, you can email us and request to be removed from such lists.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3><div>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide MEDCONNECTNEU to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</h3><div>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database onlyto be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file by Us, although it may be by payment providers such as Google Play, Apple and Stripe. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to MEDCONNECTNEU or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">COULD MY INFORMATION BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER COUNTRIES?</h3><div>MEDCONNECTNEU is incorporated in UNITED KINGDOM. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE MEDCONNECTNEU SERVICE SECURE?</h3><div>We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY INFORMATION?</h3><div>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information MEDCONNECTNEU collects depend on your relationship with MEDCONNECTNEU. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.<br><br>Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by deleting your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.<br><br>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.<br><br>If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</div>

We use the information collectedfor Human Resources purposes in order to administer benefits to workers and screen applicants.<br><br>You may contact us in order to (1) update or correct your information, (2) change your preferences with respect tocommunications and other information you receive from us, or (3) receive a record of the information we have relating to you.<br><br>Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information thatwe have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">SALE OF BUSINESS</h3><div>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of MEDCONNECTNEU or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that portion of MEDCONNECTNEU or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">AFFILIATES</h3><div>We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates.

Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</div>
        <h3 class="content-h6 my-25">WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA?</h3><div>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.<br><br>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</div><ul role="list" class="list-privacy"><li class="list-item-privacy">Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li><li class="list-item-privacy">Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li><li class="list-item-privacy">Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li><li class="list-item-privacy">People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li></ul><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">WHY IS GDPR IMPORTANT?</h3><div>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At MEDCONNECTNEU we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that aim to comply with the requirements of this new regulation.</div><h3 class="content-h6 my-25">INDIVIDUAL DATA SUBJECT'S RIGHTS - DATA ACCESS, PORTABILITY AND DELETION</h3><div>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR.
